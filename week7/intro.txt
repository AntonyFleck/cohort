Prop Drilling
just how ugly it looks 
it is just a syntactical menace when a children has to passed
down the tree when it has to used somewhere down the line


 (needs to be stored)    and passed along the right tree down 
 /\
(*)()
   /\
  () (*)

Lazy loading
giving them html incrementally
that is lazyly loading bundle components
for lazy loading your components must be exported by default


The Context API lets you fix prop Drilling

-)if you use the context API you're pushing your state management logic
outside the code react components


the context API does not fix the re-rendering problem
